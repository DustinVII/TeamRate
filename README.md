# TeamRate

This is a simple Java application that I decided to build because I have worked on many group projects in school, often in teams with an average of 5 members whereas this application allows team members to evaluate each other and assign grades during or at the end of evaluation periods.

Team members can rate each other, and an average score is calculated from the ratings given by multiple team members. At the end, each team member has an average score based on the feedback received from their teammates. This score can be used as 360-degree feedback for individual improvement.

Additionally, if there is a remaining budget at the end of a project, the application can distribute this budget among team members based on every member's average scores. 

The application allows you to input team members, assign them average scores, and, if there is a financial budget at the end of the project, it calculates how much each team member should receive.
